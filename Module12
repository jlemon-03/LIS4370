### Final Project FAQ

Topic:
For the final project, I'm not yet entirely sure what I'm doing. 

Functions:
I'm searching for a topic that will allow me to create functions that can analyze a dataset I'm interested in. I'd like to create functions that can apply various statistical analysis techniques to multiple variables, primarily predictive techniques like regressions. This could also facilitate the inclusion of a function that can take and apply these  techniques to a sample and compare it to a population, likely with the aid of a graph.
