The code:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) }

This code is clearly trying to create a function that will determine the mean of the numbers in assignment2.  However, when the code is run, it simply prints the following:

"function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) }"

I think the reason it's not working might be that it's using "return". In the document provided on how to write basic functions, it gives an example of how to write a mean function, and instead of return, uses M= and ;M. Another thing I'm not sure about are what assignment and someData in this function are supposed to be.
